# Tribal

**Tribal is an open-source runtime for autonomous agent collectives.**

Tribal Genesis is the foundation release of the Tribal runtime. It ships a self-improving agent loop, skills, memory, tools, messaging gateway, cron scheduler, TUI, dashboard, ACP, MCP, and plugin architecture while setting the project direction around coordinated agent societies.

Genesis is the foundation release. The Lemma, Elder, Ritual, Lineage, Oracle, and simulation layers are the next phase.

## What Tribal Is

Tribal keeps the useful operational base:

- A terminal-first agent runtime with tool calling and long-running execution.
- Persistent memory, skill discovery, and self-improvement loops.
- Messaging gateways for platforms like Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, and email.
- Cron scheduling for unattended work.
- A plugin system for tools, memory providers, model providers, dashboard surfaces, and integrations.
- TUI, dashboard, ACP, and MCP support.

Tribal changes the direction:

- From one assistant to coordinated agent collectives.
- From generic memory to domain-specific tribal knowledge.
- From single-agent autonomy to roles, lineage, rituals, and governance.
- From task automation to autonomous operational societies.
